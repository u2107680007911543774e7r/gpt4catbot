This is a personal project was made before there were any AppStore/GooglePlay apps for ChatGPT.
The idea was to make it possible for the users to access the ChatGPT functionality through the personal Telegram chat and be able to use it with the smartphone.

I gathered 200+ users within a couple of weeks.
As statistics say, most of the users were students who asked for help with their school tasks :) 

Later it became not relevant and OpenAI released their own apps :)

This project just remains to demostrates Python, TelegramBotAPI, OpenAI API, model fine-tuning skills.
